                    management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik

                <p>The European Crohn s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included
                    the De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of

                    CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of
                    various gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence,
                    comprising over 200 peer reviewed articles and more than 80

                <h1>Why Does It <span>Work? </span></h1>
                <p>Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
                    simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex
                    network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
                    host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
                    from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.</p>

                <p>CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
                    enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to
                    synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.
                    It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls
                    within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s
                    base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
                    knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy</p>

                <p>The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
                    which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
                    efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or
                    produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.
                    Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
                    dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering
                    proven and replicable clinical results.</p>

              <div class="nine">
                  <h3>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</h3>
                  <p>Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine
                      is altered, causing various gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for
                      maintaining digestive health, improving patient comfort, and contributing to overall well-being,
                      even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis,
                      and pouchitis.</p>

                  <h3>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h3>
                  <p>CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces
                      the severity and duration of symptoms, improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It
                      is particularly indicated for supporting intestinal health and can be beneficial in cases of
                      temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that prevents
                      normal daily activities or adequate night rest.</p>

                  <h3>Variety of Dosages:</h3>
                  <p>Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual
                      dietary needs, offering flexibility to healthcare professionals in personalizing
                      supplementation.</p>

                  <h3>Original Formulation:</h3>
                  <p>CDS22-formula is the original FormulazioneDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary
                      bacterial strains designed to maximize intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and
                      maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and consistency in every
                      production.</p>

                  <h3>Guaranteed Safety:</h3>
                  <p>Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain
                      approved by the inventor, the product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material
                      to packaging.</p>

                  <h3>Affordability:</h3>
                  <p>CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of
                      bacteria. Efficient production and direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable
                      product on the market.</p>

                <h1>De <span class="pink">Simone</span> <span class="blue">Formulation</span></h1>
                <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of
                    pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined
                    therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high
                    concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic
                    gastrointestinal disorders.</p>

                <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the
                    importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone
                    is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine
                    and
                    Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical
                    immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila
                    (Italy).</p>

                <p>He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters</p>

                <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s,
                    the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality
                    control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being
                    risks.</p>

                <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed
                    probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not
                    correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial
                    differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De
                    Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>

                <p>Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in
                    manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and
                    safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product</p>

                <h1>There is ONE De <br><span class="pink">Simone</span> <span class="blue">Formulation</span></h1>
                <p>The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify
                    formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public
                    trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand
                    name VSL#3®*, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.</p>

                <p>In 2019, VSL#3® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more
                    information: <span class="federal">Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
                    VSL#3, Schulman Bhattacharya).</span> Recently, the European Crohn s and Colitis
                    Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016
                    literature references to VSL#3® exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News,
                    2023). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
                    Metabolism) published the article “Clarifying Correct Attributions in
                    Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3®“,
                    which reiterates the above.</p>

                <p>The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name “Visbiome in the USA and
                    Canada (Exegi) and under the brand name De Simone Formulation in Korea
                    (HectoHealthcare).</p>
